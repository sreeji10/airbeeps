summary: "Creating a CockroachDB cluster"

---

CockroachDB is a distributed SQL database management system, developed by Cockroach Labs. 
It is relatively new entrant to the database space & designed for speed, scale, and survival. 
It scales horizontally; survives disk, machine, rack, and even datacenter failures. Likewise, it supports strongly-consistent ACID transactions and provides a familiar SQL API for manipulating and querying data.

If you are building demo machine learning apps then chances are that you need to log/store some training runs or other data. 
Also, if you need to test some API end points for highly distributed application, then you might find CockroachDB Serverless setup much useful.



#### Here is why should definitely check out CockroachDB
The main reason to try out CockroachDB is that they offer a Fully-managed, auto-scale CockroachDB cluster; which you can use to experiment with.

Highlights of the free tier are:
- 5 GB data storage
- 250M Request Units/month
- No credit card required

#### Create your account
- Visit https://cockroachlabs.cloud/signup to create your account 
- Enter Email ID, your username & password.
- Credit card & payment setup is not required for the free tier.

#### Create a new cluster
Once you have created your account, it's time to spin up a new database cluster. 
- On the login page, click "create cluster" button 
- Choose the Serverless plan. 
- You can choose either Google Cloud or AWS. 
- Choose the region that you would prefer your db server to be hoisted at. 
- Edit the cluster name or go with the default one. 
- Once your cluster is created, generate and save a password.

#### Create SQL user
Once the cluster is ready, we have to create a SQL user, using which we will interact with the database. 
- Define your SQL user ID
- Generate a password. 
- Make sure you copy the generated password immediately and save it separately for future use. 
- Password will not be displayed again & hence if you save it separately, or else you might have to generate it again.
- Choose the region that you would prefer your db server to be hoisted at. 
- Edit the cluster name or go with the default one. 
- Once your cluster is created, generate and save a password.

#### Connect to Database using our created user ID
- We can connect from our local system using CockroachDB client.
- We can connect using psycopg2, SQLAlchemy etc. if we are using python.
- To connect to our Database, we can use the connection string parameters.
